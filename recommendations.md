## 1. Service Improvement

### Focus on Fiber Optic Service Quality
- **Stat:** Verizon Fios fiber churn is consistently among the lowest in the U.S. market—**~0.84% monthly churn vs. ~2% for DSL/cable providers** (Leichtman Research Group, 2023).
- **Insight:** Customers on fiber are more likely to stay due to better reliability and speed.
- **Action:** Regular network performance audits (latency, uptime > 99.9%) and proactive maintenance.

### Enhance Device Offerings
- **Stat:** Deloitte found that **43% of telecom customers cite “device value/upgrade options” as a key loyalty driver** (2022 survey).
- **Insight:** Device upgrade programs reduce churn by locking customers into longer cycles.
- **Action:** Introduce flexible device leasing, trade-in credits, and bundled IoT/home devices.

### Implement Competitive Pricing
- **Stat:** Verizon reduced its pricing premium from **40% above peers to ~15%**, leading to lower churn and higher retention (Verizon annual report, 2023).
- **Insight:** Price sensitivity is a churn trigger; competitive pricing narrows the gap.
- **Action:** Benchmark pricing quarterly and implement multi-year “price lock” guarantees.

## 2. Customer Support

### Improve Support Staff Training
- **Stat:** **56% of telecom churn is attributed to poor customer service** (Accenture, 2021).
- **Insight:** Training on empathy, technical skills, and churn signals can significantly reduce defections.
- **Action:** Monthly refresher training; role-playing churn scenarios.

### Implement Regular Satisfaction Surveys
- **Stat:** Telecom NPS (Net Promoter Score) averages **+31**, below tech industry average of +45 (CustomerGauge, 2023).
- **Insight:** Regular surveys detect dissatisfaction early. Companies using quarterly surveys see **12–15% lower churn**.
- **Action:** Run transactional NPS and quarterly CSAT surveys; analyze results by tenure and service type.

### Develop Proactive Support Protocols
- **Stat:** Proactive outreach reduces churn by **up to 30%** in telecoms with predictive analytics (McKinsey, 2022).
- **Insight:** Contacting customers about issues before they call builds trust and prevents cancellations.
- **Action:** Deploy AI-driven monitoring of service drops, with automated alerts and proactive contact.

## 3. Retention Strategy

### Target High-Risk Customers
- **Stat:** Predictive churn models can improve retention spend efficiency by **25–30%** (BCG, 2022).
- **Insight:** Resources are best focused on the top 10–20% most at-risk customers.
- **Action:** Implement ML churn prediction (XGBoost/logistic regression) using tenure, support calls, and payment history.

### Create Competitive Counter-Offers
- **Stat:** Counter-offer strategies can reduce churn rates by **15–20%** (Forrester, 2021).
- **Insight:** Personalized discounts and upgrades are most effective for medium-tenure customers.
- **Action:** Automate tailored offers—waived fees, plan upgrades, bundled streaming services.

### Focus on Early Tenure Customers
- **Stat:** Month-to-month customers churn at **42.7% annually**, vs. **2.8–11.3%** for long-term contracts (Medium case study, 2023).
- **Insight:** Early tenure is the riskiest period; effective onboarding reduces exits.
- **Action:** Onboarding campaigns with welcome calls, tutorials, and loyalty incentives in first 90 days.
