# Telco Customer Churn Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn in a telecommunications company using machine learning and data visualization techniques. The analysis is based on the [IBM Telco Customer Churn Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yeanzc/telco-customer-churn-ibm-dataset). The analysis includes customer demographics, service usage patterns, and predictive modeling to identify key factors contributing to customer churn.

## 🎯 Key Features
- Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Customer demographic analysis
- Service usage pattern visualization
- Customer lifetime value (CLTV) analysis
- Churn prediction using Random Forest Classifier
- Feature importance analysis
- Detailed visualization of key metrics

## 🗃️ Dataset
The analysis uses the IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle, which includes:
- Customer demographics (age, gender, dependents)
- Account information (tenure, contract type, payment method)
- Services used (internet type, phone service, security)
- Charges (monthly charges, total charges)
- Churn status and reasons
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)

- Customer lifetime value analysis

## 📉 Visualizations
The project generates several visualization plots:
1. Churn Demographics: Customer distribution and demographic analysis
2. Value Analysis: CLTV, monthly charges, and tenure analysis
3. Service Analysis: Internet type, contract type, and payment method patterns
4. Churn Reasons: Top 10 reasons for customer churn
5. Correlation Matrix: Relationships between numerical variables
6. Feature Importance: Key predictors in the churn model
